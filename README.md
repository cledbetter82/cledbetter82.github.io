# configure-klipper.github.io

This repository contains a web applicaiton that's designed to build modular Klipper configurations. 

Do to the range of MCUs Klipper supports, and the wide variety of hardware configurations that can bee seen on printers running Klipper, its hard to provide a single firmware configuration, that would allow people to convert to klipper easilly.
To help address this, the aplicaiton splits Klipper configurations into a number of discrete components/modules, allowing the user to easily pick and choose components via the interface to match their build.
